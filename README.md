This is a real-time chat app built with React Native, Firebase and Firestore. for those who don't know, Firebase is a cloud-based real-time database. It provide many features to manage your data, here we have a list of the most important to me 😅:
<li> Authentication
<li> Storage
<li> Database
<li> Firestore
<li> Analytics
<li> AdMob
  
If you would like to know more about Firebase, you can check out the docs.
